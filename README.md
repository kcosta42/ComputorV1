# ComputorV1

About
-----
>The goal of this project is to bring us back to the manipulation of elementary mathematical tools, which can be useful in many other subjects of 42.
>
>It is not a question of "doing maths to do math", but we will approach more gradually and serenely subjects where math is necessary.

This is the first project of the Advanced Algorithms branch at School 42 Paris

Installation
------------
Run `make install`

Usage
-----
`python3 computor.py [-h] [-v] [-s] equation`
* -h: Show help message and exit
* -v: Show additional output
* -s: Show the graph of the polynomial function

### Example
```
> python3 computor.py "x^2 + 5x - 10 = 10x + 26"
Reduced form: 1.0xÂ² + -5.0x + -36.0 = 0
Polynomial degree: 2
Discriminant is strictly positive, the two solutions are:
9.00
-4.00
```

##### Project done in 2018
